      My favourite pet is the dog 😁😁😁
    </h1>
    <p id="dog">I love dogs because they are friendly , playful and cute.</p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="title">They have a strong sense of smell.</h2>
    <p id="sense">
      They possess up to 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses,
      compared to about six million in us.<br />
      And the part of a dog's brain that is devoted to analyzing smells is about
      40 times greater than ours.<br />
      Dogs also have something called neophilia, which means they are attracted
      to new and interesting odors.
